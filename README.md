# electronjs-quick-start

A basic Electron application needs just these files:
  
  -  ```package.json``` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
  -  ```main.js``` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's main process.
  -  ```index.html``` - A web page to render. This is the app's renderer process.

 # Installing Electron
 
 ```
 npm install --save-dev electron
 ```
 # Run app
 ```
 npm start
 ```
